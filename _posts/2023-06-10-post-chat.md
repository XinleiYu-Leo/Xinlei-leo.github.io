As the breakthrough of LLMs, we have seen how useful they can help us in many tasks. By leveraging the prowess of GPT, we've developed a chatbot tailored to potentially serve the research community with nuanced, domain-specific information. At its core, the system integrates LangChain for call embedding, LlamaIndex for efficient vector indexing, and the robust capabilities of OpenAI APIs. To top it all off, we've housed this powerful AI in a sleek, user-friendly interface via Gradio. With the chatbot, researchers now have immediate access to a custom database with conversational capabilities of ChatGPT.
