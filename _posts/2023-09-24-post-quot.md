> At the recent Southern California Robotics Symposium, I had the privilege of presenting our preliminary research on the effect of perception of electro-tactile stimulation. The symposium, renowned for gathering the brightest minds in robotics from the Southern California region including USC, UCLA, Cal Tech, UCI, etc., provided an engaging platform for discourse on emerging trends and technologies.
