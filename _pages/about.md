Hello World and Everyone! 

My name is Xinlei Yu, or you can call me Leo. I'm originally from [ChongQing, China (in Chinese 重庆)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing). Currently, I'm a first year Master’s student in Computer Engineering at University of Southern California, and I work in [MDL lab](https://sites.usc.edu/mdl/) and [Valero lab](https://valerolab.org/) supervised by Dr. Stacey Dusing and Dr. Francisco Valero-Cuevas. 

Ever since moved to LA on Dec 2021, I have been enjoying surrounded by beautiful beaches, breathtaking mountains, and Mediterranean climate here at LA. I like play Soccer, hangout with friends, explore trading market, and learn new things. 

Previsouly, I graduated from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) with B.S.(cum laude) in Computer Engineering in Dec 2021. I have spent four years in this great college in a small town called Ames, and met a lot of firends across the world. During the undergraduate studies, I have been an undergraudate research assistant in [BioCentury Research Farm (AG Enginnering)](https://www.biocenturyresearchfarm.iastate.edu/) and [Dependable Networking and Computing (ECE)](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~hongwei/group/index.html) respectfully. In additional, I served as undergraduate TA for Operating System class.
