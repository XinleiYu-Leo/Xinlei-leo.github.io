Hello World and Everyone! 

My name is Xinlei Yu, or you can call me Leo. I'm originally from [ChongQing, China (in Chinese 重庆)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing). Currently, I'm a second-year Master’s student in Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California, and I work in [HaVRI Lab](https://sites.usc.edu/culbertson/) advised by Dr. Heather Culbertson, where I design and develop wearable electroactive rendering device. In the first of my master's research, I worked in [Valero lab](https://valerolab.org/) supervised by Dr. Francisco Valero-Cuevas, where I developed a computer vision-based Infant Motor Learning Assistant Toy. Previously, I graduated from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) with B.S.(cum laude) in Computer Engineering in Dec 2021. I like various sports. Mainly, I like playing soccer and competing in the IM league with friends.:soccer:
