# Current Research Project 

|:------------------:|:---------------------------|
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XinleiYu-Leo/Xinlei-leo.github.io/master/assets/images/sleeve_prototype.png" alt="Sleeve Image"/>             | I'm working on a haptic project that investigates the human perception and emotional state to <strong>electro-tactile stimulation</strong>. The further goal is to build a <strong>personalized</strong> and <strong>pleasant</strong> electro-tactile device that <strong>works seamlessly with other stimulus</strong> modalities such as visual and auditory.      |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XinleiYu-Leo/Xinlei-leo.github.io/master/assets/images/eeg_loop.png" alt="eeg Image"/>             | Currently, I'm working on a project that investigates enhancing EEG-based emotion recognition by applying Kalman filtering and smoothing techniques to EEG data from the public SEED dataset. <strong>The ultimate goal is to improve the evaluation of perceptual properties and human-computer interaction by enabling more precise quantification of human emotional states through EEG signal processing.</strong>     |



# Past Research Project 

|:-------------------------:|:---------------------------|
|![electro_diagram][electro]|**Multi-armed bandit-based calibration for Electro-tactile Simulation:** Developed an electro-tactile display with a Sensory PCI card and a group of power sources and amplifiers and designed a multi-armed bandit-based calibration method to find an optimal signal parameter for pleasant stimulation. <br><br> [[Github(partially available)](https://github.com/xinleiyuUSC/MAB_UCB)] |
| ![image_3T][3T]               | **Tummy Time Toy:** A computer vision-based infant motor learning assistant toy (under US Patent review). This interactive toy rewards infants with lights and music when they lift their heads past a certain threshold, encouraging the development of prone motor skills. The primary goal is to study whether babies can learn to control their bodies during tummy time with the toy's assistance, aiding in muscle control and increasing their tolerance for tummy time.   <br><br> [[video](https://youtu.be/6PznLd5wy5c)] [Github(available soon)]  |

# Past Project

|:------------------------:|:---------------------------|
| ![image_chatbot][haptics_chatbot]              | **Chatgpt-based chatbot with Haptics Knowledge base:** A **GPT-based chatbot** with a custom haptic research database using LangChain(call embedding model), LlamaIndex(vector indexing), OpenAI APIs, and gradio(lightweight UI). Provided researchers with a chatbot with the latest and custom database in the research domain and the power of chatGPT.  <br><br> [GitHub](https://github.com/xinleiyuUSC/haptics_chatBot)  |
| ![image_artsy][artsy]                | **Artsy App:** An Android and Web application for users to search for artists from Artsyâ€™s database, look at detailed information about them(artwork image, bio, description, etc.)  <br><br> [GitHub Link](https://github.com/XinleiYu-Leo/Artsy_App)  |
