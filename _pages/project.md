# Master's Project (2022-2023)

---

## 1. Ongoing Project: Wearable Electrotactile Rendering Device		    

I am currently involved in a haptic project focusing on **electro-tactile stimulation**. Our objective is to understand human perception and emotional responses to this stimulation, with the ultimate goal of creating a **personalized**, **pleasant**, and **seamless** electro-tactile device that integrates well with other stimulus modalities like visual and auditory.

- **Presentation**: Recently, I had the privilege to present our initial findings at the [Southern California Robotics Symposium](https://sites.uci.edu/scr2023/schedule/).
- **Prototype**: Below is the Electro-tactile Sleeve prototype we are developing.

## 2. Research Project: Tummy Time Toy (July 2022 to April 2023)

I designed a computer vision-based infant motor learning assistant toy named "Tummy Time Toy" (patent pending). This toy encourages infants to develop **prone motor skills** by rewarding them with lights and music when they lift their heads past a certain threshold.

- **Demonstration**: A short demo was presented at the NSF DARE conference 2023. [Watch the Demo!](https://youtu.be/6PznLd5wy5c)

## 3. Personal Project: Haptic Knowledge Base Chatbot (May 2023)

Created a **GPT-based chatbot** equipped with a custom haptic research database. This chatbot aids researchers by providing a platform with up-to-date and custom database in the haptic research domain.

- **Repository**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/xinleiyuUSC/haptics_chatBot)

## 2. Course Project: Clustcore (Aug 2019-Dec 2019)

Engaged in the development of a bullet hell multiplayer game for Android devices, encompassing both frontend, UI, and backend operations.

- **Technologies Used**: Java with Android Studio, SpringBoot with Rest API, MySQL Database.
- **Gameplay**: Players can sign up or log in to join a game. Utilized Android Canvas API for visualizations, ObjectContainer for in-game objects and characters, WebSocket and JSON for real-time updates between server and clients/players.

## 3. Course Project: Blockchain-enabled Flight Travel Insurance System (April 2021-May 2021)

Deployed a series of Ethereum smart contracts for a flight insurance system where users can purchase policies and file claims based on predefined conditions.

- **Technologies Used**: Solidity with Remix IDE, Ropsten Test Ethereum network, Metamask.
- **Functionality**: The insurance system verifies claims using provided data (weather, locations, and time) and pays indemnities in test Ethers when claims are valid.

---

## 4. Course Project: Autonomous Cleaning Robot (April 2019-May 2019)

Developed an autonomous cleaning robot capable of navigating through a pipe maze and reaching a designated destination, all while mapping encountered obstacles.

- **Technologies Used**: C with TI Launchpad.
- **Features**: Decision-making algorithm for movement based on radar and ultrasonic sensor input, obstacle mapping on a Graphic User Interface (Putty).
- **Image**:
