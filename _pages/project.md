**Personal Project: Haptic Knowledge Base chatBot**											 	                                                                    May 2023

Built a GPT-based chatbot with a custom haptic research database using LangChain(call embedding model), LlamaIndex(vector indexing), OpenAI APIs, and gradio(lightweight UI). Provided researchers with a chatbot with the latest and custom database in the research domain and the power of chatGPT.

**Research Project: Tummy Time Toy**											 	                                                                    July 2022 to April 2023

Designed a computer vision-based infant motor learning assistant toy(patent pending) called Tummy Time Toy to study if babies can learn to control their bodies on their tummy. If so, the toy could help infants develop muscle control and tolerance of tummy time. The toy consists of two parts: front-end and back-end. The front end allows users to control the toy. The back end implements CV, control logic, and other APIs.

As the toy is under the patent review process, although I'm happy to share this exciting invention, I could not disclose many details.

**Course Project: Artsy Android App**											 	                                                                    June 2022

Built an Android mobile application for users to search for different artists from Artsy’s database, look at detailed information about them(artwork image, bio, description, etc.) using various Artsy APIs, and add them to favorites for easy access.

The project is also on the Web version. Another version of backends written in Node.js is also available.

**Senior Design Project: IoT Smart Light (Senior Design Project)**					                                                              Jan 2021-Dec 2021

-Built a web-based User Interface leveraging Python, Django, and CSS for hosting lab simulations of cyberattacks on the power grid.

-Architected backends and databases utilizing Python and SQLite3 to provide database operations for 32 Zigbee lights data and query simulation data in binary from CVS files.

-Delivered Python APIs for Xbee coordinators to interact with UI and databases with XBee Python Library by transmitted package. The package includes field light ID, name, mac address, and status.

**Course Project: Clustcore (Software Development Class)**					                                                              Aug 2019-Dec 2019

-Implemented frontend and UI for a bullet hell multiplayer game on Android devices in Java with Android Studio. Each user can sign up or log in with a pair of usernames and passwords to join a game. 

-Devised multi-player game’s backend using SpringBoot with Rest API  and MySQL Database to contain user’s information, connections, and logs.

-Utilized Android Canvas API to implement all of the visualizations on front-end, ObjectContainer to contain objects and characters in-game, and WebSocket and JSON to update the game in real time between server and clients/players.

**Course Project: Blockchain-enabled Flight Travel Insurance System**		                                                         April 2021-May 2021

-Deployed a dozen Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity with Remix IDE.  Users can purchase flight insurance policies and file claims based on given conditions. The smart contracts were deployed on the Ropsten Test Ethereum network with Metamask. 

-Designed a  smart contract extension from a basic insurance contract. The insurance can verify claims using provided data (weather, locations, and time) and pay indemnities when passengers lose in test Ethers.

**Course Project: Autonomous Cleaning Robot**							                                                                        April 2019-May 2019

-Developed an iRobot Create cleaning robot using C with TI Launchpad that can autonomously navigate through a pipe maze and reach the designated destination, while mapping obstacles it encounters to a Graphic User Interface (Putty).

-Established a decision-making algorithm to perform for choosing a moving direction based on calibrated radar and ultrasonic sensors input.
